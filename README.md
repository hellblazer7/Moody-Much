# Moody Much

## A Mood Detection and Improvement App

An app that aims to ultimately improve the mood of the user, this app detects the mood of the user using an inbuilt camera and predicts their mood accordingly. Upon detection of mood, the app makes the user play a hardware-based Snake Game made using an Arduino and an 8x8 LED Screen. With features like Meme of The Day, and a Youtube song playlist incorporated to improve the user's mood, the app makes sure the user has a great UX.

The app uses Google ML Kit for mood detection, and uses Firebase for data storage(using Firebase Realtime Database), Meme of The Day(Firebase Realtime Database) and Authentication (Firebase Authentication). Designed in Flutter, the app follows common design guidelines and practices to display an attractive UI, and provide an amazing UX. It also uses Android WebView to display the Moody Much Youtube Song Playlist.
